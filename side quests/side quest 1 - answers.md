1. `0x23b872dd000000000000000000000000` is the `transferFrom(address,address,uint256)` function selector with 12 bytes right padded zeros to prevent sending arbitrary data. Then it stores at memory space `0x0c` (decimal: 12)

2. This is used to padd zeros to the right instead of padding zeros to the left, which happens when a less than 32 bytes word is stored in memory. This is done for security reasons, to make sure that the 12 bytes before the address are all zeros.

3. Yes, it is. Because it resets the free memory pointer and the zero slot.

4. Because it is the memory offsets of the call arguments, comprising function selector and function call arguments.

5. `0x1c` is the memory offset where the `TransferFailed()` error selector starts and `0x04` is the size in memory of data to be returned when the function reverts.

6. To restore the part of the free memory pointer that was ovewritten by line 256

7. This is checking if the returned value of the `call` opcode has returned `true` (1)

8.  
    - `eq(mload(0x00), 1)` will be equal to 0
    - `iszero(returndatasize())` will be 0
    - `or(eq(mload(0x00), 1), iszero(returndatasize()))` will be 0
    - `and(or(eq(mload(0x00), 1), iszero(returndatasize())),call(gas(), token, 0, 0x10, 0x44, 0x00, 0x20))` will be 0
    - The if statement will be true and function will revert with the custom error `ApproveFailed()`
